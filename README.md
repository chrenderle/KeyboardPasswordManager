# Keyboard Password-Manager
## What is this?
This is a keyboard with an integrated password manager based on the [Redox Keyboard](https://github.com/mattdibi/redox-keyboard).
The keyboard works like a normal keyboard with a custom German layout. It is possible to configure the layout to any layout you want.
## BOM (Bill of Materials)
* Raspberry Pi Zero (W is useful for developing but not necessary)
* All the materials for a normal [Redox Keyboard](https://github.com/mattdibi/redox-keyboard) except only one Arduino Pro Micro is needed
* One 3v3 to 5v level converter like [this](https://www.amazon.de/ARCELI-Converter-Bidirektionales-Shifter-Arduino/dp/B07RDHR315/ref=sr_1_2?__mk_de_DE=%C3%85M%C3%85%C5%BD%C3%95%C3%91&dchild=1&keywords=3v3+5v+converter&qid=1618253286&sr=8-2) one
* currently, around 30 jumper cables (female to female)
